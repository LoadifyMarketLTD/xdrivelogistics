# Merge Conflicts - Executive Summary

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED (Documentation Complete)

## Problem Statement

Branch `copilot/add-delivery-tracking-system` has merge conflicts with `main` branch in 4 files:
1. `app/(portal)/loads/[id]/page.tsx`
2. `components/layout/PortalLayout.tsx`
3. `lib/types.ts`
4. `migration-delivery-tracking.sql`

## Root Cause

Both branches have **unrelated histories** (grafted branches). Each branch independently implemented similar delivery tracking features, resulting in "add/add" conflicts where both branches created/modified the same files.

## Analysis Complete ✅

All 4 files have been analyzed and compared:

### File Comparison Summary

| File | Main Branch | Our Branch | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **page.tsx** | More complete (tracking, POD, docs) | Simpler version | ✅ Use Main |
| **PortalLayout.tsx** | Complete layout (© 2021) | Had incorrect year | ✅ Use Main |
| **types.ts** | More types (User*, all tracking) | Fewer types | ✅ Use Main |
| **SQL** | Good migration (wrong branding) | Good migration (correct branding) | ✅ Use Ours |

## Resolution Strategy ✅

### Quick Answer

```
✅ Accept Main: page.tsx, PortalLayout.tsx, types.ts  
✅ Keep Ours: migration-delivery-tracking.sql
```

### Why This Strategy?

**Main Branch Provides:**
- More mature, feature-complete implementations
- Better tracking UI with events, POD, documents, notes
- Comprehensive TypeScript type system
- Production-ready code quality

**Our Branch Contributes:**
- Correct company branding in SQL
- Better database enum handling

**Result:** Best of both worlds!
